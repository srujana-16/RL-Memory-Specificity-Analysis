# RL-Memory-Specificity-Analysis
Project done as part of Behavioral Research: Statistical Methods course at IIIT Hyderabad. The project aimed to analyze behavioral research data to understand adaptive behavior and memory formation across different life stages. Through comprehensive data analysis, we investigated how age influences memory specificity and learning specificity. The objectives included exploring the relationship between experience, cognition, and memory, while addressing developmental questions about adaptive behavior.
